## Overview

AI Agent Guardian provides a secure human authentication layer for autonomous AI agents operating with blockchain operations(e.g. DeFi). It addresses the critical challenge of ensuring human oversight over high-value or high-risk transactions initiated by AI agents, preventing potential issues arising from hallucinations or unreliable AI behaviors.

### Key Features

- **Transaction Monitoring**: Configurable thresholds for transaction values and gas costs
- **Human Authentication**: Telegram-based approval system for transactions exceeding thresholds
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional additional security layer using Google Authenticator
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Configurations stored on-chain for various networks
- **Multi-Agent Management**: Support for multiple AI agents under a single user
- **Fusion+ Integration**: Special handling for cross-chain swaps

### Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: On-chain storage of agent configurations and thresholds
2. **Authentication Server**: Node.js server handling approval requests and Telegram integration
3. **AI Agent SDK**: Python implementation for AI agents to integrate with the authentication system

---

## Smart Contract Infrastructure

### Contract Details

The `AgentsRegistry` contract serves as the backbone of the system, storing and managing AI agent configurations on-chain.

#### Deployment Addresses

[TODO: Add contract addresses for supported chains]

- Base Sepolia: `0x...`
- Base Mainnet: `0x...`
- [Other supported chains...]

#### Key Structures

```solidity
struct AgentConfig {
    uint96 valueThreshold;    // Value threshold in Wei
    uint96 gasThreshold;      // Gas threshold in Wei
    bool isSetup2FA;         // 2FA status
    bool isActive;           // Agent status
    string metadata;         // Telegram chat ID
    address owner;           // Agent owner address
}
```

#### Core Functions

- `registerAgent`: Register new AI agent with initial configurations
- `updateThresholds`: Modify value and gas thresholds
- `toggle2FA`: Enable/disable 2FA for an agent
- `checkTransactionApproval`: Verify if a transaction needs approval

---

## Guardian Bot (Telegram Interface)

The Telegram bot serves as the primary interface for managing AI agents and handling transaction approvals.

### Commands

- `/start`: Initialize bot and get welcome message
- `/register`: Register a new AI agent
- `/settings`: Configure agent security settings
- `/agents`: View list of registered agents
- `/help`: Display available commands

![Telegram Bot Menu](menu.png)

### Security Features

#### Transaction Approval Flow

1. AI agent submits transaction for approval
2. Bot checks thresholds and 2FA requirements
3. Sends approval request to authorized Telegram chat
4. Processes user response (approve/reject)
5. Returns result to AI agent

#### Two-Factor Authentication

- Setup using Google Authenticator
- QR code or manual key entry
- Required for high-value transactions when enabled
- Can be toggled per agent

#### Threshold Management

- Value threshold (ETH/native token)
- Gas threshold (Gwei)
- Configurable per agent
- Real-time monitoring

## Python AI Agent Implementation

### Overview

The Python implementation demonstrates how to integrate AI agents with the Guardian system. The AI agent runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) powered by Phala Network, ensuring secure and verifiable execution of the agent's operations. This implementation leverages Phala's TEE infrastructure to guarantee that the AI agent's operations are tamper-proof and its credentials remain secure from external access.

![AI Agent Interface](ai_agent.png)

### Features

- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for intent parsing
- Multi-chain support (Base, Base Sepolia)
- Transaction history tracking
- Colorized console interface
- Fusion+ cross-chain USDC transfers
- **Secure Execution**: Runs in Phala Network's TEE environment
- **Verifiable Computation**: All operations are verifiable through TEE attestation
- **Tamper-proof Credentials**: Private keys and sensitive data are protected within the TEE

### Commands

```
Available Commands:
‚îú‚îÄ balance - Check your balance
‚îú‚îÄ send X ETH to ADDRESS - Send ETH to an address
‚îú‚îÄ fusion X USDC - Swap directly from on different chains(e.g. Base to Arbitrum) without bridging using 1inch Fusion+
‚îú‚îÄ help - Show help message
‚îú‚îÄ history - Show transaction history
‚îî‚îÄ exit - Exit program
```

### Operation Types

1. **Transfer Operations**

   - ETH transfers with threshold checking
   - Automatic gas estimation
   - Human approval integration

2. **Balance Operations**

   - Check account balances
   - Support for any address lookup

3. **Fusion Operations**
   - Swapping via 1inch Fusion+
   - Special threshold handling
   - Progress tracking

### Integration Example

```python
agent = BlockchainAgent()
agent.set_network('base-sepolia')
response = agent.process_message("send 1 ETH to 0x...")
```

## API Endpoints

### Transaction Approval

```
POST /api/request-approval
{
    "agentAddress": "0x...",
    "transaction": {
        "to": "0x...",
        "value": "1000000000000000000",
        "gasPrice": "50000000000"
    }
}
```

### Fusion+ Approval

```
POST /api/request-fusion-approval
{
    "agentAddress": "0x...",
    "amount": "1000",
    "type": "fusion"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Threshold Management

- Default value threshold: 0.00001 ETH
- Default gas threshold: 50 Gwei
- Configurable per network and agent
- Real-time price monitoring

### Authentication Layers

1. Telegram chat verification
2. Optional 2FA via Google Authenticator
3. On-chain ownership verification
4. Transaction signing validation

### Best Practices

- Enable 2FA for all production agents
- Set appropriate thresholds based on operation type
- Regular monitoring of transaction history
- Keep Telegram bot token secure
- Monitor gas prices for network conditions
